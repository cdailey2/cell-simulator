# cell-simulator

Java-based implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, applying SOLID principles and clean code practices. Designed and implemented modular, extensible components to support future scalability, enabling seamless transition into a variant project (Water World), a cell-based simulation with distinct cell types, update rules, and user interface behavior. Refactored poor code design and facilitated the union between the two projects.



- Important note: A lot of code was cleaned & refactored by me and not properly credited... Currently looking through history to update this...
