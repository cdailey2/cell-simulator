# cell-simulator

Java-based implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, applying SOLID principles and clean code practices. Designed and implemented modular, extensible components to support future scalability, enabling seamless transition into a variant project (Water World), a cell-based simulation with distinct cell types, update rules, and user interface behavior. Refactored poor code design and facilitated the union between the two projects.



<b>Important notes:</b>
- A lot of code was cleaned & refactored by me but not properly credited... Currently looking through history to update this and accurately showcase my efforts in this project... 
- Code was for a software dev project at my school and originally pulled from the organization, which is why when pressing blame all is credited to me.
- Permission was given by faculty to pull and publish this solution publicly.
